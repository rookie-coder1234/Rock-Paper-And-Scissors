## Explanation

Here I Am Importing All The Nessecary Modules Needed In This Project

```python
import random
```

Here I Am Creating The Main Class

```python
class RockPaperScissors(random.Random):
```

Here In The **init** Function I Am Creating Variables, Lists Needed In The Project

```python
def __init__(self):
    # Printing Info Message To Tell The User That The Games At 5Points
    print("The Player Who Reaches 5Points First Wins The Race! ")

    # Variables, Lists
    self.player1_score = 0
    self.player2_score = 0
    self.compplayer_score = 0
    self.comp_score = 0
    self.inputchoice = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    self.chose()
```

Here I Am Asking The Player Would They Like To Play The Game Or Not In The chose() Function

```python
def chose(self):
    self.choserunning = True
    while self.choserunning:
        self.ask = input("Would You Like To Play The Game(y/n): ").lower()
        if self.ask == "y":
            print("You Chose To Play")
            self.main()
            break

        if self.ask == "n":
            print("You Chose Not To Play")
            quit()

        elif self.ask != "y" or "n":
            print("Invalid Input!")
            continue
```

Here I Am Checking The Inputs In The check() Function With The Inputs Generated By The Computer

```python
def check(self):
        if self.compplayer_score == 5:
            print("Player Reached 5Points, Player Wins The Game :)")
            quit()

        if self.comp_score == 5:
            quit()
            print("Computer Reached 5Points, Computer Wins The Game :(")

        if self.userinput2 == "rock" and self.compchosenum == 3:
            print("Player Chosed Rock and Computer Chosed Scissors, Player Gets A Point")
            self.compplayer_score += 1
            return
        elif self.userinput2 == "rock" and self.compchosenum == 1:
            print("Both Chosed Rock Tie!")
            return
        else:
            print("Player Chosed Rock And Computer Chosed Paper, Computer Gets A Point")
            return

        if self.userinput2 == "paper" and self.compchosenum == 1:
            print("Player Chosed Paper and Computer Chosed Rock, Player Gets A Point")
            self.compplayer_score += 1
            return
        elif self.userinput2 == "paper" and self.compchosenum == 2:
            print("Both Chosed Paper Tie!")
            return
        else:
            print(
                "Player Chosed Paper And Computer Chosed Scissors, Computer Gets A Point")
            return

        if self.userinput2 == "scissors" and self.compchosenum == 2:
            print("Player Chosed Scissors and Computer Chosed Paper, Player Gets A Point")
            self.compplayer_score += 1
            return
        elif self.userinput2 == "scissors" and self.compchosenum == 3:
            print("Both Chosed Scissors Tie!")
            return
        else:
            print(
                "Player Chosed Scissors And Computer Chosed Rock, Computer Gets A Point")
            return
```

Here Is The Main Game Function

```python
def main(self):
        self.running = True
        while self.running:
            self.userinput2 = input("Rock, Paper Or Scissors: ").lower()
            self.compchosenum = self.randint(1, 3)
            if self.userinput2 not in self.inputchoice:
                print("Invalid Choice")
                continue
            self.check()
```

Here I Am Running The Code By Creating An Instance Of The Class

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    RockPaperScissors()
```
